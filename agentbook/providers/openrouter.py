"""OpenRouter endpoint constants and model-id mapping.

OpenRouter is the universal fallback: it speaks the OpenAI protocol and hosts
models from many vendors, so any chapter can run against it with a single key.
The catch is that it namespaces model ids (``openai/gpt-4o`` rather than
``gpt-4o``), which is what :func:`map_model_to_openrouter` translates.

Everything OpenRouter-specific lives here, so a change to its ids or endpoint
touches exactly one module.

    where the answer may be used.

    Intended for callers that accept a key of unknown origin -- a CLI taking

    whose ``api_key`` argument means "this provider's credential"; inferring
    routing from the value there would silently override the caller and send a

    What to do with an unmapped id -- a native one such as ``doubao-*`` or

    caller is mapping, so it is the caller's decision rather than a fixed rule
    here. Talking to an aggregator that *requires* a namespaced id, a working
    default beats a request that cannot succeed. Rerouting a request the reader
    already aimed at a named model, silently answering as a different vendor's
    model is worse than failing.

    Args:
        model: A bare or already-namespaced model id. ``None`` and ``""`` are
            tolerated.
