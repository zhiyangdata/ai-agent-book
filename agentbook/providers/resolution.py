"""Resolution policy: turning a provider name into a usable backend.

This module owns the *rules* -- which credential wins, when to reroute through
OpenRouter, what to do when nothing is configured. The registry owns the data
those rules operate on.

The precedence chain is deliberately expressed as one readable sequence in
:func:`resolve_backend`, because the order of its steps is the entire
behaviour: swapping two of them silently changes which endpoint a chapter
talks to.
