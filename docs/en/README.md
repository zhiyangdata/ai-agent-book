**Agent = LLM + Context + Tools** — This book builds on this core formula across 10 chapters, taking AI Agents from principles to engineering practice. The full text, illustrations, and **93 accompanying experiments** are all open source. You are welcome to run the experiments yourself.

> 📢 **What changed in version 2.0 (compared with 1.4):** Version 2.0 combines the “asynchronous interaction” section from the former Chapter 4 with the material on “multimodal Agents” from the former Chapter 9, reorganizing them into the new Chapter 6, “Interaction: Expanding the Observation and Action Spaces.” The former Chapters 6 (“Evaluating Agents”), 7 (“Model Post-Training”), and 8 (“Continual Evolution of Agents”) each move back one chapter and are now Chapters 7, 8, and 9, respectively.

## 📑 Content Overview (Chapters 1–10)

The book revolves around the core formula **Agent = LLM + Context + Tools**, with ten chapters building progressively:

| Ch | Topic | One-line Summary | Text | Code |
| :--: | --- | --- | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | 🚀 **Agent Fundamentals** | **Agent = LLM + Context + Tools**; Harness engineering is the real competitive edge | [Read](../../book-en/chapter1.md) | [4](../../chapter1/README.en.md) |

| 4 | 🛠️ **Tools** | Tools are the Agent's hands: MCP protocol, perception/execution/collaboration tools, event-driven async Agents, proactive tool discovery | [Read](../../book-en/chapter4.md) | [8](../../chapter4/README.en.md) |
| 5 | 💻 **Coding Agent & Code Generation** | Code is a "tool that creates new tools"; production-grade Coding Agent in full | [Read](../../book-en/chapter5.md) | [13](../../chapter5/README.en.md) |
| 6 | 🎙️ **Interaction: Expanding the Observation and Action Spaces** | Expand the Agent's observation and action spaces across modality and time: asynchronous and event-driven systems, voice, Computer Use, and robotics | [Read](../../book-en/chapter6.md) | [14](../../chapter6/README.en.md) |
| 7 | 🎯 **Evaluating Agents** | Turn performance into comparable signals: evaluation environments, metrics, statistical significance, and evaluation-driven selection | [Read](../../book-en/chapter7.md) | [13](../../chapter7/README.en.md) |

## 💻 Run the Companion Experiments

The shared supported range is **Python 3.11–3.13**. Install dependencies by chapter from the repository root; replace `ch1` with `ch2` through `ch10` for another chapter:

```bash
# Recommended: use the committed uv.lock for a reproducible chapter environment
uv sync --locked --extra ch1

# Without uv: resolve from pyproject.toml with pip
python -m pip install -e ".[ch1]"
```

Before running an experiment that calls a model, follow that experiment's README for credentials. Experiments that support root-level configuration can use `.env.example` copied to `.env` with at least one provider key; some experiments instead require an adjacent `.env` or exported environment variables. Use local Ollama with `--provider ollama` only when that experiment's README or CLI lists it.

Then run an experiment from the repository root, for example:

```bash
uv run python chapter1/context/main.py
# After a pip install, you can also run: python chapter1/context/main.py
```

- See the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). `pip` remains supported but resolves fresh instead of using the lockfile.
- Existing experiment-level `requirements.txt` files remain supported during migration, especially for isolated projects or special version constraints.
- `all` is broad and CPU-friendly, not literally every experiment. `uv sync` exactly syncs the current selection each time, so combine special extras in one command, such as `uv sync --locked --extra ch2 --extra vllm` or `uv sync --locked --extra ch7 --extra unsloth`; the pip equivalent is `python -m pip install -e ".[ch2,vllm]"`.
- Follow each experiment's README for system dependencies such as browsers, CUDA, FFmpeg, Ollama, Playwright browsers, and external repositories. Some vendored Chapter 8 components require Python 3.12+.

## 🔑 API Keys

It is recommended to apply for API keys from several platforms for convenient learning. See [this guide](https://01.me/2025/07/llm-api-setup/) for model selection.

| **DeepSeek** | <https://platform.deepseek.com/> | Official DeepSeek API | Global + Mainland China |
| **Atlas Cloud** | <https://www.atlascloud.ai/> | Access models from multiple vendors through an OpenAI-compatible API | Global |
| **Krill AI** | [www.krill-code.com](https://www.krill-code.com/register?invite=Q8D3L35725) | One-stop access to major global and China-domestic models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, Qwen, Minimax) | Global + Mainland China |
